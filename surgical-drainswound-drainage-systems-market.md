<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Surgical Drains/Wound Drainage Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The surgical drains and wound drainage systems market comprises two primary types: passive drains and active drains. Passive drains rely on gravity and natural body processes to facilitate fluid flow, allowing drainage through gravity without suction. They are simple and cost-effective but may be less efficient. Active drains, on the other hand, use suction mechanisms to actively remove fluid from the wound site, promoting quicker healing and reducing infection risk. This differentiates them in terms of effectiveness and application in clinical settings.</p></p>
