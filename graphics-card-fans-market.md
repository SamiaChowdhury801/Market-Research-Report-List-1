<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphics Card Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial Fans</li><li>Centrifugal Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The graphics card fan market primarily includes axial and centrifugal fan types. Axial fans, commonly used in graphics cards, push air parallel to the fanâ€™s axis, offering high airflow at lower pressure, making them effective for cooling components. Centrifugal fans, on the other hand, draw air in and expel it perpendicular to their axis, generating higher pressure and more targeted airflow, suitable for confined spaces. Each type caters to specific cooling needs, impacting performance and thermal management in graphics-intensive applications.</p></p>
