<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The FRD Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Tube</li><li>Double Tube</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The FRD (Fractured Rock Drilling) module encompasses two main market types: Single Tube and Double Tube systems. Single Tube systems use one tube for both drilling and core retrieval, making them simpler and lighter, but with less core protection. In contrast, Double Tube systems employ an outer casing that captures the core undisturbed, providing better sample integrity and protection from external influence. These systems cater to different geological environments and operational needs, enhancing drilling efficiency and sample quality.</p></p>
