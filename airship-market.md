<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airship Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Semi Rigid</li><li>Non-rigid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airship market is categorized into three types: rigid, semi-rigid, and non-rigid. Rigid airships have a solid framework to maintain their shape, providing greater structural integrity and capacity for long-distance travel. Semi-rigid airships possess a partially flexible structure, allowing for a balance between durability and design flexibility. Non-rigid airships, or blimps, rely entirely on internal gas pressure to maintain shape, making them lighter and easier to operate, but limiting their capacity and range compared to the other types.</p></p>
