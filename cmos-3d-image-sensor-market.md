<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS 3D Image Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Backside-illuminated(BSI)</li><li>BSI Stacked</li><li>Front-illuminated(FI)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CMOS 3D image sensor market consists of three primary types: Backside-illuminated (BSI), BSI Stacked, and Front-illuminated (FI) sensors. BSI sensors allow light to reach the photodiodes more efficiently by placing the circuitry behind the sensor, enhancing low-light performance. BSI Stacked sensors further improve performance by stacking additional layers, enabling advanced processing and higher pixel density. In contrast, Front-illuminated sensors have the wiring in front, which can obstruct light, resulting in lower sensitivity and image quality.</p></p>
