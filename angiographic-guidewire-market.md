<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Angiographic Guidewire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>PTFE Coated</li><li>Uncoated</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The angiographic guidewire market can be divided into two main types: PTFE coated and uncoated guidewires. PTFE coated guidewires feature a layer of polytetrafluoroethylene, which enhances lubricity, reduces friction, and improves navigation through intricate vascular pathways. This coating is particularly beneficial in complex procedures. Uncoated guidewires, while simpler in construction, offer good tactile feedback and can be preferable in certain situations due to their cost-effectiveness. Both types cater to varying clinical needs and procedural requirements in angiography.</p></p>
