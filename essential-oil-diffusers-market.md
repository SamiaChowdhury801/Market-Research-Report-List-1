<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Essential Oil Diffusers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ultrasonic Diffuser</li><li>Evaporative Diffuser</li><li>Nebulizing Diffuser</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The essential oil diffuser market features three primary types: ultrasonic, evaporative, and nebulizing diffusers. Ultrasonic diffusers use water and ultrasonic waves to disperse a fine mist of essential oils, providing moisture along with aroma. Evaporative diffusers utilize a fan to blow air through a pad or wick, causing the oil to evaporate, which may enhance scent dispersal but can alter oil properties. Nebulizing diffusers convert essential oils into a fine mist without water, delivering pure aroma directly into the air. Each type caters to different user preferences and experiences.</p></p>
