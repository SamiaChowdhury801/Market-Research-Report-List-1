<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emissions Analysers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>In-situ</li><li>Extractive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Emissions analysers are categorized into two main market types: in-situ and extractive. In-situ analysers are installed directly at the emission source, providing real-time measurement of gas concentrations and enabling immediate monitoring and compliance. Extractive analysers, on the other hand, draw samples from the emission source and analyze them in a separate unit, often allowing for more detailed analysis but with a slight delay. Both types play crucial roles in environmental monitoring and regulatory compliance across various industries.</p></p>
