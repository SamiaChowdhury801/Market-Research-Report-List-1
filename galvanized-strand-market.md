<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Strand Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electro Galvanized Strand</li><li>Hot-Dip Galvanized Strand</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The galvanized strand market is primarily divided into two types: electro-galvanized strand and hot-dip galvanized strand. Electro-galvanized strand involves a process where zinc is applied to the steel surface through electrolysis, providing a uniform, thin coating that offers moderate corrosion resistance. In contrast, hot-dip galvanized strand is immersed in molten zinc, resulting in a thicker, more robust coating that enhances durability and corrosion protection. Both types are widely used in construction, telecommunications, and utility applications due to their strength and longevity.</p></p>
